SYNOPSIS

    In dist.ini:

        [Test::CPAN::Changes]

DESCRIPTION

    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

        xt/release/cpan-changes.t - a standard Test::CPAN::Changes test

    See Test::CPAN::Changes for what this test does.

 Alternate changelog filenames

    CPAN::Changes::Spec specifies that the changelog will be called
    'Changes' - if you want to use a different filename for whatever
    reason, do:

        [Test::CPAN::Changes]
        changelog = CHANGES

    and that file will be tested instead.
